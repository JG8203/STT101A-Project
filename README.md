# STT101A Group Culminating Project

This project is meant to apply lessons learned in Statistics, particularly Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. The goal is to analyze data from the `STT101A PROJECT POPULATION DATA SET` using various statistical techniques. This data set includes details from 538 households in the Philippines across 14 variables of interest.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to carry out the project. It involves various statistical analysis techniques on a given data set.

### Prerequisites

- STT101A Project Population Data Set
- Microsoft Excel
- PHStat
- Microsoft Word/PowerPoint

## Project Tasks

Here is a comprehensive checklist of tasks to be accomplished in this project:

- [x] Use the STT101A Project Population Data Set with population size N = 538.
- [x] Obtain a random sample of size n = 70.
- [x] Create a new Excel file "Sample Data Set" with only the data from the 70 sampled households.
- [ ] Apply the following using the "Sample Data Set", Excel and PHStat:
  - [x] Topic: Does location type affect poverty status? Statistical Test: Chi-Square Test
  - [ ] Topic: Is there a correlation between monthly income and monthly expenditure? Statistical Test: Correlation and Regression Analysis **CRASHES PHSTAT, TRY ON WINDOWS**
  - [ ] Topic: Is the proportion of agricultural households different in coastal areas compared to upland and metropolis? Statistical Test: Chi-Square Test for Equality of Proportions
  - [ ] Topic: Does the sex of the head of the household have an effect on the total number of members in the household? Statistical Test: Independent Samples t-test
  - [ ] Topic: Do households in different poverty classifications spend the same proportion of their income on food? Statistical Test: Chi-Square Test for Equality of Proportions
  - [ ] Topic: Are households in upland, metropolis, and coastal areas using different types of roof materials? Statistical Test: Chi-Square Test for Equality of Proportions
  - [ ] Topic: Is the average age of the head of the household different for households with single, extended, and nonrelative members? Statistical Test: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
  - [ ] Topic: Is the average monthly income of households with predominantly strong materials (for either roof or walls) different from those with light or salvaged materials? Statistical Test: Independent Samples t-test
  - [ ] Topic: Is there a correlation between the age of the head of the household and the number of members aged less than 5 years old? Statistical Test: Correlation and Regression Analysis
  - [ ] Topic: Is there a difference in monthly expenditure between poor, almost poor, and non-poor households? Statistical Test: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- [ ] Perform the 5-step test of hypothesis, formulate the group's hypotheses, and draw conclusions.
- [ ] Create a PowerPoint/Slide presentation with the complete report following all previous instructions.

## Presentation

- [ ] Be ready to present in Week 13.
