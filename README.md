# STT101A Group Culminating Project

This project is meant to apply lessons learned in Statistics, particularly Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. The goal is to analyze data from the `STT101A PROJECT POPULATION DATA SET` using various statistical techniques. This data set includes details from 538 households in the Philippines across 14 variables of interest.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to carry out the project. It involves various statistical analysis techniques on a given data set.

### Prerequisites

- STT101A Project Population Data Set
- Microsoft Excel
- PHStat
- Microsoft Word/PowerPoint

## Project Tasks

Here is a comprehensive checklist of tasks to be accomplished in this project:

- [x] Use the STT101A Project Population Data Set with population size N = 538.
- [x] Obtain a random sample of size n = 70.
- [x] Create a new Excel file "Sample Data Set" with only the data from the 70 sampled households.
- [ ] Apply the following using the "Sample Data Set", Excel and PHStat:
  - [ ] Interval Estimation of One Population Mean
  - [ ] Interval Estimation of One Population Proportion
  - [ ] Hypothesis Testing of One Population Mean (z-test or t-test)
  - [ ] Hypothesis Testing of One Population Proportion (z-test)
  - [ ] Hypothesis Testing for Two Population Means (Independent sample t-test)
  - [ ] Hypothesis Testing for Two Population Proportions
  - [ ] Analysis of Variance
  - [ ] Chi-Square Test of Equality of Several Proportions
  - [ ] Linear Correlation and Regression
- [ ] Write interpretations for the intervals from interval estimation.
- [ ] Perform the 5-step test of hypothesis, formulate the group's hypotheses, and draw conclusions.
- [ ] Create a PowerPoint/Slide presentation with the complete report following all previous instructions.

## Presentation

- [ ] Be ready to present in Week 13.
